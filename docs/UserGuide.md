## Saving the data

SirDukeBox data are saved automatically as .txt files in the same directory as the `sirDukeBox.jar` file.  
The files are saved as `SirDukeBox.txt` and `DukeFinance.txt`

## Loading the data

Existing SirDukeBox data (from a previous session) are loaded automatically upon start up

> NOTE: Any changes made to the .txt files outside of the
> functionalities of SirDukeBox (e.g. editing the .txt file manually in notepad)
> may render its format invalid. This may result in `SirDukeBox` being unable
> to load an existing .txt file

## FAQ

How do I transfer my data to another computer?

> Having installed the app in the other computer, overwrite the empty data files created
> (`SirDukeBox.txt` and `DukeFinance.txt`) with the existing files that contains the data from your
> original computer.

Should I edit the save files manually?

> SirDukeBox save files are not meant to be edited manually. Editing the save files manually in a
> text editor runs the risk of corrupting the existing data, after which SirDukeBox may be unable to
> load the file upon start up.

Can I `add` instruments of the same `INSTRUMENT_NAME`, `INSTRUMENT_MODEL` and `INSTRUMENT_YEAR`?

> Yes, in the event that you have two identical instruments, SirDukeBox allows duplicate entries
> of instruments with the same `INSTRUMENT_NAME`, `INSTRUMENT_MODEL` and `INSTRUMENT_YEAR`.

Can I `return` a reserved instrument before its `START_DATE`?

> No, SirDukeBox requires that instruments must be rented for at least one day from its `START-DATE`.
> If the `START_DATE` has yet to pass, it is assumed that the instrument has not been loaned out for
> a reservation yet.
